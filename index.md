Hi!

I'm Barak Itkin, a Software/Algorithm engineer, a teacher, a dancer, and a person who does too many things, with not enough time. In short, here are the important points about me:

* I'm currently working as a **Software Engineer** at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), after previously working at [Google](https://www.google.com). Before that, I also
  worked as a **Computer Vision and Algorithms Engineer** in [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com). For more details about my current and past employment, check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/barakitkin/).
* I taught the [Introduction to Information Security](https://infosec.cs.tau.ac.il/) course at
  [Tel Aviv University](https://www.tau.ac.il) from 2017 to 2022.
* I graduated my **Masters degree in Computer Science** in 2019, after studying at
  [Tel Aviv University](https://www.tau.ac.il) under the guidance of [prof. Lior Wolf](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/).
  My thesis, [Ranking Systems for Computer-Aided Single-View Pottery Classification](https://tau.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/972TAU_INST/quev9q/alma9933001299604146)
  is about automated pottery classification for archaeology, by both shape and appearance. A shorter version (in
  paper format) is available on arXiv ([Computational Ceramicology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09960)), and a similar
  version was [published in _AAAI-21, the 35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence_](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17740).
* I'm dancing, teaching and managing the [Media West](https://www.facebook.com/groups/186049541552575/) dance
  school/club in Tel Aviv. We are a group of volunteers that teach **West Coast Swing**, and if you don't know what
  that is, you really should take a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=west+coast+swing+jack+and+jill).
