Hi!

I'm Barak Itkin, a Software/Algorithm engineer, a teacher, a dancer, and a person who does too many things, with not enough time. In short, here are the important things:

* I'm currently working at [Google](https://www.google.com) as a **Software Engineer**, and previously I worked in [Magic Leap](https://www.magicleap.com) as a **Computer Vision and Algorithms Engineer**. I also worked in a few other places previously, check my [LinkedIn](my-linkedin) if you need more information.
* I'm teaching in the [Introduction to Information Security](https://infosec.cs.tau.ac.il/) course at [Tel Aviv University](https://www.tau.ac.il).
* I graduated my **Masters degree in Computer Science** in 2019, after studying at [Tel Aviv University](https://www.tau.ac.il) under the guidance of [prof. Lior Wolf](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/). My thesis, [Ranking Systems for Computer-Aided Single-View Pottery Classification](http://primage.tau.ac.il/libraries/theses/exeng/free/9933001299604146.pdf) is about automated pottery classification for archaeology, by both shape and appearance. A shorter version (in article format) is available on arXiv - [Computational Ceramicology
](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09960).
* I'm dancing, teaching and managing the [Media West](https://www.facebook.com/groups/186049541552575/) dance school/club in Tel Aviv. We are a group of volunteers that teach **West Coast Swing**, and if you don't know what that is, you really should take a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=west+coast+swing+jack+and+jill).
